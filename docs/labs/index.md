## Labs
As part of the class, we are building a few labs in both SystemVerilog and Vitis HLS.
Unfortunately, we only have one lab so far.  But, we will add more over the course of the
semester.

* [Unit 2: Division with conditional subtraction](./subc/)
   * Implement a simple integer mathematical algorithm in SystemVerilog
   with a FSM and a handshake protocol.
* [Unit 3:  Fixed point implementation of a cubic function](./cubic/)
   * Implement a simple function in fixed point in SystemVerilog
   and validate against a python Golden model
