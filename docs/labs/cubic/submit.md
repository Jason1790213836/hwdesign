# Submitting the Lab

For NYU students that want to receive credit for the lab,
if you are running the Vitis and Vivado on your local machine, 
run the python command:

```bash
python run_tests.py --tests all --submit
```

Or, if you are on the NYU server:

```bash
uv run python run_tests.py --tests all --submit
```

This program will look at the test vectors and validate that the tests have passed.
The program will create a zip file `submission.zip` with:

- `submitted_results.json`:  A JSON file with the test results
- `cubic.ipynb`:  Your python implementation
- `cubic.sv`:  Your SV implementation
- `tb_cubic.sv`:  Your SV testbench implementation
- `test_results/tv_....csv`:  Various test vectors

Submit this zip folder on Gradescope on the lab assignment.  A Gradescope autograder will upload the grade.  If you are on the NYU server, you will need to copy the `submission.zip`
file back to your local machine to submit.
