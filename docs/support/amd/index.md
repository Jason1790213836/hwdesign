# Vitis and Vivado

Most of the hardware design in the class will use two tools from AMD:

* **Vitis HLS** used to design and simulate the hardware accelerators
in a simple C-like programming language
* **Vivado** used to create FPGA projects with the Vitis IP, processing system and peripherals

This directory provides some notes in setting up and using this software.
