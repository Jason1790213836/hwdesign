## Remote GUI Connection with Fast-X


You can do most of all the labs and demos from the terminal and SSH only.
But, if you want a GUI, you can do the following:

* Download the [FAST-X client](https://www.starnet.com/download-fastx-client/)
    * Clients are available for Window, MacOS, and Linux
* Launch the Fast-X client
    * On Windows, you can launch it from the Start menu
* Before connecting, you must be on the NYU network (either on campus, or connected via VPN)
* In the Fast-X Window, select the **+** sign near the top left to add a connection.  Select
host, username and port as above.
* The connection option will now appear in the main window.  Double click on that.
* Enter your NYU password
* One connected there will be another **+** sign near the top left.  Select that sign and
you will be provided an option for a Gnome terminal or Default Desktop.  You can use either.
