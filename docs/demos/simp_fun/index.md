# Basic Digital Logic

In this introductory unit, we will build our first simple hardware module
with sequential logic.
The module will implement a basic arithmetic function, such as multiplying two numbers or evaluating a polynomial.
Along the way, you will learn to:
- Describe simple hardware modules using **sequential logic** combining **clocks**, and **registers**
- Implement the hardware module in **SystemVerilog**
- Write a **testbench** to validate the module’s functionality
- Simulate, synthesize, and implement your design in **Vivado**

Subsequent units will mostly use Vitis HLS instead
of SystemVerilog.  Vitis HLS is a higher level language
that enables rapidly implementing complex operations.
However, we start with SystemVerilog since it is low-level and let you develop a mental model
for what the hardware does.
